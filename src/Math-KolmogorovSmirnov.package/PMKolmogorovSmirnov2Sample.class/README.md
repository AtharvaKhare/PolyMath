does a two-sided Kolmogorov-Smirnow test and checks whether two sample data are from the same population, which is assumed to be a continous distribution (iow  ties occur with probability zero ). 
#ksStatistic returns kolmogorovs D.
#pValue returns the probability of getting a D < ksStatistic .
#rejectEqualityHypothesisWithAlpha: does what its name says of course.
example:
nd:= DhbNormalDistribution new.
ks :=KolmogorovSmirnov2Sample  
	compareData: ((1 to:100) collect:[:i|nd random]) 
	withData: ((1 to:100) collect:[:i|nd random]). "-->
a KolmogorovSmirnov2Sample(dataSize: 100 otherDataSize: 100)"
k ksStatistic . "-->(9/100)"
k pValue asFloat ."-->0.18458528753386905"
ks rejectEqualityHypothesisWithAlpha: 0.05. "-->false"

the pValue is directly (no SmirnovDistribution implemented at the moment) and exactly calculated as explained in:
Kim, P. J. & Jennrich, R. I. 
'Tables of the exact sampling distribution of the two-sample Kolmogorovâ€“Smirnov criterion...'
in 'Selected Tables in Mathematical Statistics Volume I' (1973).

no aproximation is at the moment used for bigger datasizes, hence calcs will be too slow in that case.
