do 'ConfigurationOfRealInterval  load.' or 'ConfigurationOfRealInterval  loadDevelopment .'

 if you do this this, there will first be made a test whether RealInterval is probably compatible with your image, and if it is not, nothing is loaded. you can then run TestOldMethods (see comment there), load 'core' and adjust the methods accordingly.
