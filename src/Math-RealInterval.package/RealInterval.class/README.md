a RealInterval is a closed interval of numbers where its infimum and supremum are both #Number's. if both are Float nan, it is empty. the numbers, it consists of, are reals if  ConsistsOfFloatsOnly is false and they are only Floats if ConsistsOfFloatsOnly is true. this differentiation affects only #split: at the moment (its just experimental, like the comments methods which are used very sparingly and dont move trough calculations at the moment. they would need extra logic for moving, but then i think they could be useful to get better results).
