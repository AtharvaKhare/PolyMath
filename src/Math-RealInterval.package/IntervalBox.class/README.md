An IntervalBox is simply an Array of Intervals or IntervalUnions that can be splitted and has several other convenience methods. hence it is used as an interval-vector for vector functions in the algos.
it is conceptually different from IntervallUnion insofar as IntervallUnion is one - dimensional whereas IntervalBox is multi - dimensional.
